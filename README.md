Hot Stone Massage Treatment


This is my first project for coding. I choose to build a website for a Hot stone treatment in a beauty salon as I myself have worked as a beauty therapist and had dreams of opening a salon of my own at one point. It is a website to book yourself or anyone you choose to to book in for a relaxing treatment. Booking a course by signing up gives you one treatment free.

Table of contents

Treatment name
Menu bar cotaining sign up section, about treatment ethos section and a sign up section.
There is a call now link to ring the salon.
Social Media links to Facebook and Instagram.
